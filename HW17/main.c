	 *  1. Check for number of arguments. If less than 2, do not proceed further.
	 *
	 *  2. The program should create a binary search tree from the numbers in input file. The input file 
	 *  	also contains a number for search query at the end. 
	 *
	 *  3. The input file has one number per line. If there are 'n' lines in the file, the first n-1 numbers 
	 *  	are the elements of the binary search tree and the nth line is the search query. 
	 *  	NOTE: n is not given to you. 
	 *
	 *  4. Create an array of the first n-1 numbers and store the last number in a variable.
	 *
	 *  5. Create a Binary Search Tree. It takes four arguments:
	 *  	1. The array
	 *  	2. the first element of the array
	 *  	3. start index (index of first element of the array)
	 *  	4. end index ( index of last element of the array)
	 *
	 *  6. Print the created tree in Inorder fashion. Quick check if you have created the tree right: the output of
	 *  	will be a sorted array of numbers. 
	 *
	 *  7. Compute the distance of the 'search query' node by passing it to the function.
	 *
	 *  8. Use PrintDistance() function to print the distance of the node from the root node in the right format.
	 *
	 *  9. Free all memory.
